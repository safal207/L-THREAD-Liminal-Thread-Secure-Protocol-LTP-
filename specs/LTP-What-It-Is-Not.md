# What LTP Is Not (Non-Normative)

This document clarifies what the Liminal Thread Protocol (LTP) explicitly is **not**.

Its purpose is to prevent category errors, overloading expectations,
and architectural misuse of the protocol.

---

## LTP is NOT a Recommendation System

LTP does not aim to predict user preferences,
optimize engagement,
or maximize conversion metrics.

It does not rank content by popularity, similarity, or historical behavior.

Orientation is not recommendation.
Branches are not suggestions.
Confidence is not probability.

---

## LTP is NOT a Machine Learning Framework

LTP does not require:
- training datasets
- model weights
- gradient descent
- reinforcement learning
- neural architectures

ML or LLM components MAY be used by implementations,
but are entirely optional and non-normative.

---

## LTP is NOT a Data Storage System

LTP does not define:
- databases
- schemas
- persistence guarantees
- replication strategies

Frames are transient by design.
State may be forgotten.
Silence is meaningful.

---

## LTP is NOT a Workflow Engine

LTP does not enforce:
- step-by-step processes
- state machines
- task pipelines
- orchestration graphs

Flows may pause, branch, or dissolve without completion.

---

## LTP is NOT an Optimization Protocol

LTP does not optimize for:
- speed
- throughput
- efficiency
- minimal latency
- maximal accuracy

Graceful degradation is preferred over optimal performance.

---

## LTP is NOT an Autonomous Decision Maker

LTP does not make decisions.
It does not act on behalf of users or agents.

It provides orientation, not authority.
Responsibility remains external.

---

## LTP is NOT a Replacement for Human Judgment

LTP does not remove ambiguity.
It does not eliminate uncertainty.
It does not guarantee correctness.

Its purpose is to *make uncertainty navigable*, not disappear.

---

## Design Principle

If an implementation claims LTP but:
- enforces outcomes,
- hides uncertainty,
- collapses plurality into a single answer,

it is likely violating the spirit of the protocol.

---

## Summary

LTP is a protocol for **orientation in uncertainty**.

Everything else is optional.
