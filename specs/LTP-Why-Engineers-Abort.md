# Why Engineers Abort LTP

## This is not a product
- No dashboards-first thinking
- No instant ROI promises
- No "just plug in an LLM"

## Determinism over dopamine
- If you expect novelty → abort
- If you need reproducibility → welcome

## LTP will feel slow at first
- Because understanding replaces guessing
- Because explainability replaces tuning

## LTP does not optimize outcomes
- It exposes structure
- It preserves optionality
- It avoids forced decisions

## If this frustrates you — good
- That means the protocol is working

Kubernetes, Rust, Terraform, and early OpenTelemetry used this posture to earn deep trust.
