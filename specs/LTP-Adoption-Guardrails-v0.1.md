# LTP Adoption Guardrails v0.1

## Start with DevTools
- Observability
- Routing visibility
- Explainable flows

## Do NOT start with agents
- Agents amplify chaos without structure
- LTP provides structure first

## Fintech comes second
- Determinism
- Replayability
- Graceful degradation

## Recommendation systems are last
- Only after orientation is trusted
- Only after routing is explainable

## LTP should feel boring in production
- Predictable
- Stable
- Inspectable

These guardrails keep LTP from becoming just another AI tool and anchor it as an operational protocol.
