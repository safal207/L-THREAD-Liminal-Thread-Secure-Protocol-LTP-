# Liminal OS Integration Plan — Geometry of Meaning

## Stages
1. **Add LTP Geometry Layer**: integrate MGL encoding/decoding in the transport stack.
2. **Liminal Sense**: ingest Meaning Geometry to maintain real-time intention maps.
3. **Foresight Engine (L31, L34)**: consume future branches for scenario projection.
4. **Decision Layer (L20)**: apply Smart Routing to select and justify paths.
5. **Liminal Shell (Turtle UI)**: render orientation, horizon span, and stability for operators.
6. **Consciousness Web**: merge multiple threads, prevent collapse, and surface resonance hotspots.

## Deliverables
- SDK bindings exposing `MeaningNode` graphs and routing APIs.
- Telemetry channel for tension, clarity, and resonance metrics.
- Visualization toolkit for Turtle Orientation Shell.
- Ops playbook for tuning resonance thresholds and stability guards.

## Success Metrics
- Reduction in decision latency with maintained or increased clarity scores.
- Higher adoption of recommended branches (measured resonance vs. executed path).
- Operator trust scores for explanations generated by Smart Routing.
