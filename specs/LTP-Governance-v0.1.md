# LTP Governance v0.1 (Draft)

## Purpose
This document defines how the Liminal Thread Protocol (LTP) evolves over time.

LTP governance is designed to:
- prevent single-vendor control
- allow independent implementations
- favor stability over speed
- preserve human-oriented semantics

Governance defines *process*, not *authority*.

## Core Principles
- Open by default
- Fork-friendly
- No canonical implementation
- No mandatory foundation or DAO
- Rough consensus over voting

## Advisory Board

The LTP Advisory Board provides:
- conceptual guidance
- protocol review
- long-term coherence

The Advisory Board:
- has no merge authority
- does not own the protocol
- does not control implementations

> Guidance without ownership.
