# LTP Geometry of Meaning — v1

The Geometry of Meaning layer turns LTP into a sense-oriented navigation system, mapping intentions, temporal branches, and resonance between choices.

## What It Provides
- Temporal orientation across multiple possible futures.
- Focus modeling and clarity tracking for agents and humans.
- Prediction and scoring of future branches by resonance and viability.
- Route explanations that surface why a pathway is recommended.
- Support for assisted choice, aligning agency with transparent reasoning.

## Why It Matters
People and agents decide based on **meaning**, not just raw data. Geometry of Meaning is the first standard that encodes intention dynamics directly into the protocol layer, making LTP suitable for cognition-aware systems.

## Core Constructs
- **Thread Vector**: intention, tension, momentum, clarity, timeDepth.
- **Meaning Node**: semantic state with resonance and future branches.
- **Consciousness Web**: integration layer stitching threads into a cohesive surface.
- **Turtle Orientation Shell**: orientation and stability of focus across time.
- **Smart Routing**: filters branches and returns the most resonant path with rationale.

## Files in This Package
- `specs/LTP-Geometry-v1.md` — protocol-facing specification.
- `specs/Geometry-Math-Core.md` — mathematical foundation.
- `docs/PITCH-Geometry-of-Meaning.md` — investor/partner narrative.

## How to Use
1. Embed `MeaningNode` graphs into LTP payloads via the Geometry layer.
2. Run the Smart Routing algorithm to rank branches by resonance.
3. Surface the Turtle Orientation Shell in UI/telemetry for human alignment.
4. Feed results into decision layers or forecasting engines.
