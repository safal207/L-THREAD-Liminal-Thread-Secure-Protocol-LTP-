VISUAL MANIFEST — GEOMETRY OF MEANING (brief for designers)

- **Spider (Consciousness Web):** lattice of luminous nodes connected by threads; thickness encodes resonance strength.
- **Turtle (Orientation Shell):** slow, stable guide with a glowing compass ring showing rotationAngle and horizonSpan.
- **Threads:** translucent paths with pulse amplitude reflecting tension; momentum is shown as arrow flow.
- **Future Branches:** folded ribbons ahead of the turtle; clarity sharpens their edges, low clarity blurs them.
- **Resonance:** soft glows between nodes; higher coherence produces brighter interference patterns.
- **Router Core:** central prism that selects a branch; emits a short caption explaining the chosen path.
- **Color Language:**
  - Clarity → cyan
  - Tension → amber
  - Momentum → magenta vectors
  - Stability → deep blue shell
  - Resonance → violet highlights

Deliverables: hero graphic, minimal icon set, and a timeline strip showing branch selection.
