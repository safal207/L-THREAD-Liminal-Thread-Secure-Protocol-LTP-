# LTP DevTools Manifesto

LTP exists to make **complex decision systems inspectable, deterministic, and explainable** — without black boxes.

This is a DevTools project.
Not a product.
Not a platform.
Not a recommendation system.

---

## Why LTP exists

Modern systems increasingly rely on:
- multi-step decision flows
- agent handoffs
- context-dependent transitions

Yet engineers are expected to:
- debug outcomes they cannot replay
- audit logic they cannot inspect
- explain decisions made by opaque systems

LTP addresses this gap by defining a **protocol-level contract** for decision routing and continuity.

---

## What LTP is

- A **protocol**, not a runtime
- A **standard**, not an optimization engine
- A **deterministic layer** for transitions and decisions
- A **verification and inspection surface** for complex systems

LTP can be embedded, validated, audited, and extended — without vendor lock-in.

---

## What LTP is not

LTP is not:
- a machine learning model
- a recommender system
- an orchestration framework
- a user-facing product

If you are looking for predictions, rankings, or optimization — LTP is not the right tool.

---

## Who LTP is for

LTP is designed for:
- platform engineers
- infrastructure and DevTools teams
- fintech, trading, and risk systems
- AI agent platforms requiring continuity and auditability

If you are responsible for systems where **explainability and determinism matter**, LTP is for you.

---

## Design principles

- Determinism over heuristics
- Inspection over inference
- Contracts over conventions
- Continuity over stateless calls

---

## How LTP is used

Teams use LTP to:
- verify decision routing
- inspect multi-path outcomes
- audit transitions and handoffs
- establish compliance boundaries

LTP integrates with existing systems — it does not replace them.

---

## The role of DevTools

DevTools are not an afterthought in LTP.
They are the **primary interface** between engineers and complex systems.

Verification, inspection, and conformance are first-class citizens.

---

## Final note

LTP does not promise better decisions.

It promises **decisions you can understand, verify, and trust**.
