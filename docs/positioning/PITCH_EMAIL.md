Subject: Making AI agents audit-ready with LTP (deterministic trace layer)

Hi [Name],

We built L-THREAD Protocol (LTP) as a deterministic trace layer for AI agents. It provides replayable, audit-grade evidence of agent decisions—so compliance and security teams can verify behavior, not just outputs.

If you’re running agents in regulated or high-risk workflows, LTP adds decision continuity, drift detection, and “golden trace” baselines without re-architecting your stack. It also integrates cleanly with MCP as an audit layer for multi-agent orchestration.

Would you be open to a short call to explore a PoC or pilot? We can provide a sample trace replay and audit report from one of your workflows.

Best,
