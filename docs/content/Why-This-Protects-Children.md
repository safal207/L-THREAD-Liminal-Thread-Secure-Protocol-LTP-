# Why LTP Protects Children (And Brands)

## For Parents: "Proof, not Promises"

Today, when you turn on "Kids Mode" on a platform, you are trusting a black box. You hope their algorithms work. When something slips through (a scary video, a bad ad), the platform says "oops, glitch."

**With LTP, safety is mathematically proven.**

LTP creates a "digital flight recorder" for the stream.
*   **Before** any video is shown, the system checks: "Does this match the 'Safe for Kids' signature?"
*   If the check fails, the video simply **cannot play**. The protocol forbids the transition.
*   If something does slip through, you (or a watchdog group) can audit the "flight recorder" file. It will show exactly *why* it was allowed, exposing the flaw immediately.

## For Platforms: "Safety by Design"

LTP moves safety from "Cleanup Crew" to "Architectural Guarantee".

*   **Audit Trails:** Prove to regulators and advertisers that your brand safety filters were active and working.
*   **Incident Resolution:** Instead of vague PR statements, you can publish the technical trace showing "We blocked 99.9% of attacks, here is the proof."
*   **Advertiser Trust:** Brands can verify that their ads only appeared in "Green Verified" stream contexts.

## For Streamers: "AI Co-hosts that won't get you banned"

Using AI on stream is risky. What if it says a slur? What if it hallucinates?

LTP acts as a **latency buffer and brain** for your AI.
1.  AI thinks of a sentence.
2.  LTP checks it against Twitch/YouTube TOS *in real time*.
3.  If it's toxic, LTP **blocks** the voice output and forces the AI to retry.
4.  The audience never hears the toxic remark. You stay safe.
