# LTP v0.1 Market Narrative — Meaning & Orientation Infrastructure

## Category Definition
LTP establishes the **Orientation protocol layer** for AI-driven systems—a transport-agnostic, storage-agnostic, language-agnostic substrate for meaning, routing, and explainable navigation. It packages Frames, Canonical Flow, and Conformance so builders can align orientation signals and routing outcomes across stacks.

## Why Now
- **AI adoption surge:** Teams ship agents, copilots, and recommender loops faster than they can align message semantics.
- **Interoperability chaos:** Each SDK/API defines its own envelope, breaking continuity across languages and transports.
- **Governance needs:** Enterprises require deterministic, explainable routing to audit decisions without freezing innovation.

## What Changes
- From **prediction-only pipelines** to **navigation/orientation flows** where frames make intent, posture, and futures explicit.
- From **SDK-or-API silos** to a **protocol + conformance layer** that keeps Rust nodes, JS SDKs, and HUDs in parity.
- From **opaque outputs** to **branchable, explainable route responses** that reveal alternative futures instead of single-point predictions.

## Who Benefits
- **Streaming & recommendations:** stable branches and orientation to reduce oscillations and regressions.
- **Fintech decision systems:** auditable routing with deterministic replays and silence-as-signal handling.
- **Agents & automation:** shared frames for hello/heartbeat/orientation/routing across transports.
- **Devtools & observability:** HUDs consume `focus_snapshot` without bespoke adapters per stack.

## Competitive Landscape
- **Typical SDK/API:** ties semantics to a runtime or transport; interoperability is incidental.
- **LTP Protocol + Conformance:** frames, canonical flow, and determinism rules that travel across languages and transports, with optional certification and self-tests to keep the ecosystem coherent.

## Business Model Preview (Non-binding)
- **Conformance kit:** reusable tests and fixtures for JS SDKs, Rust nodes, and HUDs.
- **Certification & registry:** publish conformant implementations and capabilities for orientation/routing parity.
- **Enterprise audits:** deterministic replay and branch-order verification for regulated environments.

## What We Are Not
- Not a model or inference service.
- Not a data warehouse or persistence layer.
- Not a transport replacement (works over WS/REST and others).
- Not introducing new frame types beyond v0.1.

## Non-goals
- Guaranteeing perfect predictions or single-path outcomes.
- Mandating a specific UI/UX or HUD design.
- Enforcing centralized storage or topology.
