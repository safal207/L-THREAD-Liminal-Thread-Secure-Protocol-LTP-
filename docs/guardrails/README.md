# Guardrails

This folder contains strict engineering guidance for building on LTP
without violating the canon.

Guardrails are NOT canon.
They may evolve as implementation experience grows.

Canon lives in: `docs/canon/*`
- Acts define the non-negotiable conceptual foundation.
- Canon changes require the LCP/RFC process.

Use Guardrails for:
- threat modeling and security boundaries
- misuse patterns and failure modes
- product guidance and non-goal enforcement
- orientation interpretation guidance

If a Guardrail contradicts the Canon, the Guardrail is wrong.
