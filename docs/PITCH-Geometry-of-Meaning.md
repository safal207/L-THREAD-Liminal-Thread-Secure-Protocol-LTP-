# Geometry of Meaning — Investor Manifesto (DeepTech Edition)

## Why the World Needs This
We are building the second internet: the Internet of Meaning. Today’s stack moves data, ownership, and answers. It does **not** move intention, focus, or directional clarity. Liminal Thread Protocol (LTP) with the Geometry of Meaning layer is the first protocol to encode sense trajectories directly.

| Technology | What it moves | Missing piece |
| --- | --- | --- |
| HTTP | Data | Meaning & direction |
| Web3 | Ownership | Orientation of intent |
| LLMs | Answers | Structured agency graph |
| **LTP** | **Meaning & developmental direction** | **Solved** |

## Market Scale
- Universal layer for humans, AI agents, enterprises, cities, and ecosystems.
- New control surface for navigation, forecasting, and coordination.
- Positions LTP as the TCP/IP of agency and sense-making.

## Proof Points
- Native **Smart Routing** selects the most resonant trajectory and explains why.
- **Consciousness Web** integrates multiple intention threads without collapse.
- **Turtle Orientation Shell** visualizes stability and future reach.

## Monetization Paths
- API access to Geometry Routing and Resonance Scoring.
- Enterprise dashboards for foresight and decision hygiene.
- Licensable SDKs for agent frameworks and cognitive UIs.

## Call to Action
Join the pilot program to instrument your systems with Geometry of Meaning. Back the reference implementation and help standardize the Internet of Meaning.
