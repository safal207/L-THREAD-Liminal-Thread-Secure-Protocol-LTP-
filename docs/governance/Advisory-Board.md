# LTP Advisory Board

## Role: Strategic Guidance, Not Control

The LTP Advisory Board is a small group of distinguished, independent experts from across the industry. Their role is to provide strategic, non-binding guidance to the LTP Maintainers on high-level technical direction, security landscape, and long-term ecosystem health.

Crucially, the Advisory Board has **no direct authority or veto power** over the RFC process. Its influence is derived solely from the weight and wisdom of its advice. This separation ensures that the board serves as a source of credibility and strategic insight, without compromising the open, community-driven nature of the governance model.

## Why an Advisory Board?

1.  **Industry Credibility:** An independent board composed of respected experts signals to the industry that LTP is a serious, long-term protocol, not a proprietary project.
2.  **Expert Counsel:** It provides the Maintainers with access to world-class expertise in critical domains like cryptography, protocol design, and large-scale systems, helping to avoid strategic blind spots.
3.  **Neutrality:** The board acts as a safeguard for the protocol's neutrality, ensuring it continues to evolve in a way that benefits the entire ecosystem, not a single vendor.

## Membership and Process

-   **Invitation:** Members are invited by a unanimous decision of the LTP Maintainers.
-   **Term:** Advisors serve renewable two-year terms to ensure a regular influx of fresh perspectives.
-   **Meetings:** The board meets quarterly with the Maintainers to discuss the protocol's roadmap, major RFCs, and the broader technology landscape.
-   **Transparency:** The list of board members is public. Summaries of advisory discussions may be published, respecting confidentiality where necessary.

The detailed process for nominating and seating board members is managed by the Maintainers as part of the overall governance model.
