These illustrative materials explain LTP concepts but are not part of the protocol specification.

To avoid committing binary assets, the images live outside this repository. Download or reference them from your preferred artifact store and place them locally under `docs/media/` if needed for presentations or docs builds. Use them in documentation, talks, and articles with attribution to the LTP project.
