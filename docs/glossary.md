## Canonical Terms

**Orientation** — persistent reference frame governing continuity across time.

**Trajectory** — ordered sequence of orientation transitions.

**Drift** — measured deviation from intended orientation.

**Admissible Future** — a future state that preserves continuity constraints.

**Snapshot** (Frozen Light) — immutable orientation capture used for replay and recovery.

**Continuity** — property that transitions remain coherent across retries, restarts, and agents.
