# LTP Glossary (Normative)

**Orientation** — an explicit, persistent reference frame
that anchors system state across transitions.

**Trajectory** — an ordered sequence of transitions
preserving continuity of orientation over time.

**Transition** — a discrete state change governed by protocol rules.

**Drift** — accumulated deviation of orientation
caused by transitions or external perturbations.

**Focus Node** — the protocol-defined locus
where orientation, constraints, and admissible futures intersect.

**Admissible Future** — a future branch
that satisfies protocol constraints and invariants.

**Continuity** — the property that system behavior
remains coherent and replayable across time and retries.

**Replayability** — the ability to deterministically
reconstruct orientation and transitions from protocol artifacts.
