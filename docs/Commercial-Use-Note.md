# Commercial Use Note

LTP specifications are open to implement and extend. Implementations, gateways, and hosted services can be commercial, provided they respect versioned compatibility.

The conformance kit is the shared baseline: use it to validate that frames, ordering, and outcomes remain interoperable across stacks. Publishing conformance results alongside releases is encouraged.

Vendors are welcome to build paid support, routing services, or monitoring around LTP. Keep flows transparent, keep payloads deterministic, and prefer interoperability over lock-in.
