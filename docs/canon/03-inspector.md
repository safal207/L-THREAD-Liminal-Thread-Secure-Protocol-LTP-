# Act IV — Inspector as Mirror

## Key Image
```
Inspector
- reveals orientation timeline
- measures drift / entropy / continuity
- explains degraded paths
- does not optimize
- does not command
```

## Thesis
The inspector does not judge.
It reveals.

## Engineering Formula
Inspector = microscope, not a gavel: observe and report continuity signals without prescribing actions.
