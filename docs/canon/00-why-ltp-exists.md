# Act 0 — Why LTP Exists

## Key Image
Before: More data → bigger models → fragile coherence

After: Continuity → orientation → resilient intelligence

## Opening
AI systems did not fail because they were weak.
They failed because they forgot who they were.

At scale, prediction becomes noise.
At speed, optimization becomes drift.
Under pressure, memory fractures.

What breaks first is not intelligence.
What breaks first is **orientation**.

## The Hidden Problem
Modern AI is built on snapshots:
- stateless inference
- episodic memory
- reward-local optimization

Each step may look correct.
The trajectory is not.

Systems act *correctly* and still end up somewhere wrong.

This is not a bug.
It is a missing layer.

## The Missing Layer
LTP exists because something fundamental was absent:

A continuous axis that answers:
- who am I now?
- how did I get here?
- what futures remain admissible?
- what must not be broken?

Not a controller.
Not a planner.
Not a policy.

An **orientation layer**.

## What LTP Is (and Is Not)
LTP is not:
- a model
- a memory store
- a reward system
- a decision engine

LTP is:
- a living thread through time
- a coherence substrate
- an orientation carrier under drift, scale, and failure

## The Law
Prediction degrades with complexity.
Orientation does not.

This is why LTP exists.

## Engineering Formula
When systems grow:
- state explodes
- prediction confidence collapses
- local optimality diverges from global coherence

LTP preserves orientation continuity so intelligence survives its own scale.
