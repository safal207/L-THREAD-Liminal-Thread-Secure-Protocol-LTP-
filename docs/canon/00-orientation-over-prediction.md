# Act I — Orientation over Prediction

## Key Image
```
Classic AI:
Input → Prediction → Action → (context lost)

LTP:
Input → Orientation → Action
           ↑
     continuity over time
```

## Thesis
Prediction breaks under scale.
Orientation survives.

## Engineering Formula
LTP does not predict outcomes; it preserves orientation so outcomes remain coherent.
