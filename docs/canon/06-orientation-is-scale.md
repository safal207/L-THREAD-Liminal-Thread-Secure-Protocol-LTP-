# Act VI — Orientation Is the New Scale

## Key Image
```
When systems grow:
Prediction collapses.
Orientation scales.
```

## Thesis
Orientation is the new scale.
This is the epochal law.

## Engineering Formula
As system complexity ↑, prediction reliability ↓; orientation continuity preserves coherent outcomes.
