# LTP Canon

These texts define the non-negotiable conceptual foundation of LTP.

They are not tutorials.
They are not marketing.
They are not implementation details.

If an interpretation of LTP contradicts this canon,
the interpretation is wrong.

Canon status: STABLE.
Changes to canon must go through the LCP/RFC process.
Canon is above tutorials, README, and marketing.
**Canon version:** see `docs/contracts/CANON_VERSION.md`.

Canonical requirements live in [docs/contracts/REQUIREMENTS.md](../contracts/REQUIREMENTS.md).
Canon ↔ Contract mapping: [docs/contracts/CANON_MAP.md](../contracts/CANON_MAP.md).
