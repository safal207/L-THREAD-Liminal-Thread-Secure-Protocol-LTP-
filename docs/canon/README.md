# LTP Canon

These texts define the non-negotiable conceptual foundation of LTP.

They are not tutorials.
They are not marketing.
They are not implementation details.

If an interpretation of LTP contradicts this canon,
the interpretation is wrong.

Canonical requirements live in [docs/contracts/REQUIREMENTS.md](../contracts/REQUIREMENTS.md).
Canon ↔ Contract mapping: [docs/contracts/CANON_MAP.md](../contracts/CANON_MAP.md).
