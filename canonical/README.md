# Canonical LTP Trace v0.1

This file defines the minimal valid trace for the Liminal Thread Protocol.

It is used as:
- a reference artifact for implementers
- a baseline for conformance tests
- a replayable orientation timeline
- a stable anchor for future protocol evolution

This trace:
- does not run a model
- does not choose actions
- does not depend on runtime state

If your implementation cannot ingest, validate, and replay this trace,
it is not LTP-compliant.
