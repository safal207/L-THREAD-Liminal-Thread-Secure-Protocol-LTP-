# LTP Advisory Board Charter (v0.1)

The Advisory Board provides non-binding guidance to keep the protocol neutral, secure, and interoperable. It does not merge code, accept/reject RFCs, or control releases; Maintainers and contributors own execution.

## Purpose
- Promote protocol neutrality and multi-vendor interoperability.
- Surface security and compatibility risks early in the RFC process.
- Recommend mitigations and new RFCs without acting as a gatekeeper.

## Authority boundaries
- **Advisory-only:** recommendations are public and non-binding; RFC/ADR owners own decisions.
- **No gatekeeping:** proposals and implementations remain open to all contributors who follow the RFC process.
- **Transparency:** positions and reviews are logged alongside RFCs/ADRs.

## Conflicts of interest
Members disclose employment, investments, and vendor ties relevant to LTP. Anyone with a material conflict for a topic recuses from recommendations on that item.

## Membership
- **Appointment:** Maintainers invite candidates with interoperability/security experience; nominations can open during quarterly or roadmap planning.
- **Removal:** a simple majority of Maintainers may remove an inactive member or one with unresolved conflicts that jeopardize neutrality.
- **Rotation:** 1-year renewable terms; rotations encouraged to avoid capture.

## Operating rhythm
- Meets quarterly (or ad-hoc) to review in-flight RFCs and emerging risks.
- Publishes short advisory notes (2–5 bullets) tied to RFCs; dissent is recorded.
- Maintains a public list of members and optional public minutes, published at least monthly when meetings occur.
