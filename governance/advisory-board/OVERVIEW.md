# LTP Advisory Board (v0.1)

The Advisory Board provides direction without control. It safeguards protocol intent and neutrality while leaving execution to maintainers and contributors.

## Role
- Does **not** merge code or accept/reject RFCs.
- Provides advisory opinions on RFCs, especially governance, neutrality, and Flow evolution.
- Publishes annual protocol reviews and optional public statements.
- Offers non-binding guidance to implementations, operators, and ecosystem vendors.

> The Board influences gravity, not motion.

## Composition
- Protocol architects familiar with Frames/Flow/Conformance.
- Distributed systems engineers with production experience.
- Product and market thinkers who understand adoption incentives.
- Ethics and safety observers (optional) to monitor systemic risk.

## Operating Model
- Convene quarterly (minimum) to review active RFCs and ecosystem signals.
- Issue short advisory notes with rationale, dissent, and neutrality checks.
- Maintain a public log of statements, including when the Board declines to opine.

## Authority
- Non-binding; influence comes from clarity, consistency, and public accountability.
- Maintainers remain responsible for merges and conformance updates.
- The Board may recommend new RFCs or flag fragmentation risks but cannot impose them.
