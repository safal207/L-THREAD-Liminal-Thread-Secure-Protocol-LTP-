# LTP Maintainers

## Lead Maintainer
- Aleksey Safonov — overall direction, release stewardship, and temporary veto authority to protect the Frozen Core.

## Advisory Board (Placeholder)
Advisory members will be added as the project formalizes its governance. Their role will be to provide guidance, challenge assumptions, and support adoption without overriding the maintainer or editor responsibilities.
