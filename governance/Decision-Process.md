# Decision Process (v0.1)

Decisions balance speed with inclusivity to keep LTP practical for operators and safe for adopters.

## Signals
- Rough consensus drives acceptance; clear dissent is recorded and linked.
- Silence = signal; extended silence during Last Call is treated as low-risk agreement, not a veto.
- Evidence from fixtures, conformance runs, and production telemetry carries high weight.

## Handling Disagreement
- Disagreement is documented, not suppressed. Counterproposals SHOULD include compatibility and safety analysis.
- Forking is allowed, fragmentation discouraged; compatibility profiles SHOULD be published when forks occur.
- Escalations may request Advisory Board notes to surface risks and tradeoffs.

## Decision Text
> Consensus does not mean unanimity.

## Publication
- Each decision includes rationale, dissent, version impact, and required updates to specs or kits.
- Decisions are indexed alongside RFCs for future audits and operator guidance.
