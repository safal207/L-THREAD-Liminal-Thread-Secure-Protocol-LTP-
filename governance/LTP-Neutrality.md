# LTP Neutrality (v0.1)

Neutrality keeps LTP safe for enterprises, open-source contributors, and independent operators. It ensures no single actor can capture the protocol.

## Non-Negotiable Neutrality Guards
- No mandatory cloud
- No mandatory vendor
- No mandatory ML
- No mandatory license
- No mandatory persistence

> You can sell LTP services, but you cannot own LTP.

## Enforcement Levers
- Conformance tests MUST remain runnable offline and on commodity hardware.
- Protocol extensions MUST NOT require proprietary dependencies for basic interoperability.
- Hosted services MAY offer value-add layers but MUST preserve the open protocol contract.

## Alignment with Specs
- Frames and Flow remain deterministic and inspectable; routing explainability is prioritized over opaque automation.
- Conformance and adoption guides MUST highlight neutral deployment patterns (self-hosted, hybrid, air-gapped).
- Governance decisions that threaten neutrality require RFC-Governance review with explicit dissent capture.
