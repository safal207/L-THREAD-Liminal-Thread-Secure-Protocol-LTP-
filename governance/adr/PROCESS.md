# ADR / Decision Process

ADRs log outcomes of RFCs and major governance choices. They stay short: what was decided, why, and the consequences.

## Numbering & filenames
- Use the next zero-padded ID: `0001-short-title.md`.
- Update the [ADR Index](./INDEX.md) with ID, title, status, owner, and link back to the RFC.

## Lifecycle
- **Proposed:** Draft ADR opened with the decision intent and related RFC.
- **Accepted:** Decision is final; consequences and follow-up are captured.
- **Superseded:** A later ADR replaces or updates this decision.

## Recording a decision
1. Link to the RFC and PR that triggered the decision.
2. Capture rationale, dissent, compatibility/interop notes, and required actions.
3. Update the ADR status and the index; supersede older ADRs when appropriate.
