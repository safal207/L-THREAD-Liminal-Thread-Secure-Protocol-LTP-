# LTP Governance Toolkit (v0.1)

This directory contains lightweight governance artifacts to keep LTP additive, neutral, and interoperable.

## Core Documents
- [LTP Governance](./LTP-Governance.md) — principles and commitments.
- [RFC Process](./RFC-Process.md) — lifecycle and roles for proposing changes.
- [Decision Process](./Decision-Process.md) — how outcomes are recorded.
- [LTP Neutrality](./LTP-Neutrality.md) — non-authority and multi-vendor guardrails.
- [LTP Versioning](./LTP-Versioning.md) — compatibility and release cadence.
- [Advisory Board](./ADVISORY_BOARD.md) — charter for advisory-only guidance.

## Templates
- [RFC Template](./RFC_TEMPLATE.md) — required sections for clarity and compatibility.
- [Decision Record Template](./DECISION_RECORD_TEMPLATE.md) — consistent logging for Accepted/Rejected/Deferred outcomes.

## Usage
- Start with the RFC template when proposing any protocol or governance change.
- Capture outcomes with a Decision Record and link it to the corresponding RFC/PR.
- Seek Advisory Board input for neutrality or security concerns; recommendations are non-binding but logged for transparency.
