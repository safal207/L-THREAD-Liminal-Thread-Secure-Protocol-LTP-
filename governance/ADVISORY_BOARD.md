# LTP Advisory Board

This document outlines the purpose, membership, and operating model of the LTP Advisory Board.

## Purpose

The Advisory Board serves as a source of independent, expert guidance for the LTP Maintainers. Its primary role is to ensure the protocol's long-term health, neutrality, and strategic alignment with the broader technology landscape. The board's influence is purely advisory; it does not have direct control over the project.

## Membership Criteria

Members are invited by the LTP Maintainers based on their expertise and reputation in one or more of the following domains:

- **Cryptography and Security:** Deep knowledge of cryptographic principles, secure protocol design, and threat modeling.
- **Protocol Design:** Experience with designing, standardizing, and maintaining network protocols.
- **Infrastructure & Operations:** Expertise in large-scale distributed systems, network operations, and cloud infrastructure.
- **Developer Experience (DX):** A strong background in building and advocating for developer-centric tools and APIs.
- **Standards Bodies:** Experience working with formal standards organizations (e.g., IETF, W3C).

## Expectations

- **Provide Strategic Review:** Offer feedback on high-impact RFCs, particularly those with long-term architectural or security implications.
- **Maintain Neutrality:** Help ensure that the protocol does not become biased toward any single vendor or implementation.
- **Act as Ambassadors:** Optionally, represent LTP in public forums and help build connections with other standards bodies and communities.
- **Time Commitment:** Participate in periodic (e.g., quarterly) reviews and be available for occasional ad-hoc discussions.

## Placeholder Seats

The following seats represent the desired areas of expertise for the initial Advisory Board. They are currently open for nomination.

- **Seat 1: Security & Cryptography**
- **Seat 2: Protocol Design & IETF Relations**
