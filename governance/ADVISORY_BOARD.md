# LTP Advisory Board Charter (v0.1)

The LTP Advisory Board provides non-binding guidance to keep the protocol neutral, secure, and interoperable. It does not wield authority over implementations, releases, or governance decisions. Coordination ≠ control.

## Purpose
- Promote protocol neutrality and multi-vendor interoperability.
- Surface security and disclosure guidance early in the RFC process.
- Identify compatibility risks and recommend mitigations.

## Role Boundaries
- **Advisory only:** recommendations are recorded; Maintainers/Editors own acceptance decisions via RFCs and Decision Records.
- **No gatekeeping:** proposals and implementations remain open to all contributors who follow the RFC process.
- **Transparency:** positions and reviews are logged using Decision Records and linked to RFCs.

## Membership
- **Appointment:** Maintainers invite candidates with demonstrated interop/security experience; nominations can be opened during quarterly planning.
- **Term & Renewal:** 1-year renewable terms; rotations encouraged to avoid capture.
- **Removal:** majority of Maintainers may remove a member for inactivity or conflicts that jeopardize neutrality.

## Operating Rhythm
- Meets quarterly (or ad-hoc) to review in-flight RFCs and emerging risks.
- Publishes short advisories (2–5 bullets) tied to RFCs; no separate approval gate.
- Maintains a public list of members and meeting summaries in the governance directory.
