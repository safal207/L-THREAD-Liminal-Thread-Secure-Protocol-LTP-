# LTP Advisory Board

## Role: Strategic Guidance, Not Control

The LTP Advisory Board is a small group of distinguished, independent experts from across the industry. Their role is to provide strategic, non-binding guidance to the LTP Maintainers on high-level technical direction, security landscape, and long-term ecosystem health.

Crucially, the Advisory Board has **no direct authority or veto power** over the RFC process. Its influence is derived solely from the weight and wisdom of its advice. This separation ensures that the board serves as a source of credibility and strategic insight, without compromising the open, community-driven nature of the governance model.

## Membership Criteria

Members are invited by the LTP Maintainers based on their expertise and reputation in one or more of the following domains:

- **Cryptography and Security:** Deep knowledge of cryptographic principles, secure protocol design, and threat modeling.
- **Protocol Design:** Experience with designing, standardizing, and maintaining network protocols.
- **Infrastructure & Operations:** Expertise in large-scale distributed systems, network operations, and cloud infrastructure.
- **Developer Experience (DX):** A strong background in building and advocating for developer-centric tools and APIs.
- **Standards Bodies:** Experience working with formal standards organizations (e.g., IETF, W3C).

## Membership and Process

-   **Invitation:** Members are invited by a unanimous decision of the LTP Maintainers.
-   **Term:** Advisors serve renewable two-year terms to ensure a regular influx of fresh perspectives.
-   **Meetings:** The board meets quarterly with the Maintainers to discuss the protocol's roadmap, major RFCs, and the broader technology landscape.
-   **Transparency:** The list of board members is public. Summaries of advisory discussions may be published, respecting confidentiality where necessary.
